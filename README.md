- **Multiple Colors:** Unleash your creativity with a palette of colors, easily switchable as you paint.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for all ages, the intuitive interface ensures you can start painting with no prior setup or learning curve.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The backbone of our application, providing robustness and flexibility.
- **OpenCV:** The Open Source Computer Vision Library powers our image and video processing, including advanced color detection and contour analysis.
- **NumPy:** Integral for numerical computations and array manipulation, crucial for processing image data efficiently.

## Setup
1. **Install Python:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Dependencies:** Quickly set up the required dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```
3. **Run the Application:** Kickstart the virtual painting experience by executing the main Python script:
    ```bash
    python virtual_paint.py
    ```

## Usage
1. **Launch the Application:** Position yourself in front of the camera.
2. **Select a Color:** Choose from a vibrant selection of colors (e.g., yellow, blue).
3. **Start Painting:** Use your fingertips to paint in mid-air. The application detects your finger movements, translating them into colorful strokes on the video feed.
